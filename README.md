## About

Individual project developed within Henry Bootcamp.

It consists of a single page application using React and Redux for state management. 

All components were developed with CSS and Sass without the use of external libraries.

The SPA consumes data from an API (pokeapi.co) through a Back End developed in Node.JS using Express, which added new features to the original API.
